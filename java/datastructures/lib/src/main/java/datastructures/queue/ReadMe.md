# Queue Challenge
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
Removes the node from the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty queue
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Animal Shelter

Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: animal
animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
It must have a species property that is either "cat" or "dog"
It must have a name property that is a string.
dequeue
Arguments: pref
pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.
